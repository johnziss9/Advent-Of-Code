<h1>Advent of Code</h1>

This is my attempt to try and solve all the puzzles in the adventofcode website.

Each day (from the 1st to the 25th of December) there are two new puzzles available to solve.

I will not be doing them as they come out but I will try to solve all of them using C#.

There will be a new branch for each puzzle.
